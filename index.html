<h2>What is this site about?</h2>
<p>Hi there! You've found your way to my personal site, and I'm super glad you did :) Here you'll find more information than you probably want to know about me. You'll learn about my professional experience, education, and volunteering (more to come). You'll also be able to get in touch with me, which I encourage you to do if you find anything here of interest, have any ideas you'd like to share, or have any questions. Thanks, and hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
