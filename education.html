    <h4>Research & Publications:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Robotic vision and control for grasping clear plastic bags:</b> Developed both classical and deep-learning-based methods for grasping clear plastic bags with a parallel gripper, and unsolved problem in robotics with significant industrial implications (e.g., warehouse picking). Demonstrated that a neural network that processes depth and RGB images in parallel can be effective for this task. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07631">Link to paper.</a></li>
        <li><b>Realistic audio generation from silent video using deep learning:</b> Developed several neural network architectures designed to observe silent video and generate realistic audio waveforms to accompany it. Models created video context embeddings as well as embeddings for past audio context, and then used modules transformer-based or Wavenet-based architectures to generate realistic audio. Models were successful for simple videos (e.g., clapping hands, muscle car driving). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12408">Link to paper.</a></li>
        <li><b>Solving a ball maze with a robotic arm and computer vision:</b> Programmed Sawyer industrial robotic arm to navigate a ball through a maze by tilting the maze. Computer vision system enabled ball localization and pathfinding. <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/106206afinalprojectteam7/home?authuser=1">Website with results.</a></li>
